# STM32F103C8-BareMetal-LED
LED Blinking for STM32F103C8

In the above code I tried to blink PA0 pin connected as outpur for LED blinking using baremetal coding,
which is working in keil and same code I used in STM Cube IDE where I didn't get any errors.

The code I have uploaded in proteus, when I upload hex file from keil it's working properly but 
when I upload hex file from STM Cube IDE, it's not working
